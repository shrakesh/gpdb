  <shortdesc>Best practices for designing Greenplum Database schemas.</shortdesc>

  <body>
    <p>Greenplum Database is an analytical, shared-nothing database, which is much different than a
      highly normalized, transactional SMP database. Greenplum Database performs best with a
      denormalized schema design suited for MPP analytical processing, a star or snowflake schema,
      with large centralized fact tables connected to multiple smaller dimension tables.</p>

        <title>Use Types Consistently</title>
        <p>Use the same data types for columns used in joins between tables. If the data types
          differ, Greenplum Database must dynamically convert the data type of one of the columns so
          the data values can be compared correctly. With this in mind, you may need to increase the
          data type size to facilitate joins to other common objects. </p>

        <title>Choose Data Types that Use the Least Space</title>
        <p>You can increase database capacity and improve query execution by choosing the most
          efficient data types to store your data. </p>
        <p>Use <codeph>TEXT</codeph> or <codeph>VARCHAR</codeph> rather than <codeph>CHAR</codeph>.
          There are no performance differences among the character data types, but using
            <codeph>TEXT</codeph> or <codeph>VARCHAR</codeph> can decrease the storage space used. </p>
        <p>Use the smallest numeric data type that will accommodate your data. Using
            <codeph>BIGINT</codeph> for data that fits in <codeph>INT</codeph> or
            <codeph>SMALLINT</codeph> wastes storage space. </p>

    <title>Storage Model</title>


    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database provides an array of storage options when creating tables. It is very
        important to know when to use heap storage versus append-optimized (AO) storage, and when to
        use row-oriented storage versus column-oriented storage. The correct selection of heap
        versus AO and row versus column is extremely important for large fact tables, but less
        important for small dimension tables. </p>
      <p>The best practices for determining the storage model are:<ol id="ol_fvc_wdy_gr">
          <li>Design and build an insert-only model, truncating a daily partition before load.</li>
          <li>For large partitioned fact tables, evaluate and use optimal storage options for
            different partitions. One storage option is not always right for the entire partitioned
            table. For example, some partitions can be row-oriented while others are
            column-oriented. </li>
          <li>When using column-oriented storage, every column is a separate file on <i>every</i>
            Greenplum Database segment. For tables with a large number of columns consider columnar
            storage for data often accessed (hot) and row-oriented storage for data not often
            accessed (cold). </li>
          <li>Storage options should be set at the partition level.</li>
          <li>Compress large tables to improve I/O performance and to make space in the
            cluster.</li>
        </ol></p>
      <section id="heap_vs_ao">
        <title>Heap Storage or Append-Optimized Storage</title>
        <p>Heap storage is the default model, and is the model PostgreSQL uses for all database
          tables. Use heap storage for tables and partitions that will receive iterative
            <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, <codeph>DELETE</codeph>, and singleton <codeph>INSERT</codeph>
          operations. Use heap storage for tables and partitions that will receive concurrent
            <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, <codeph>DELETE</codeph>, and <codeph>INSERT</codeph>
          operations. </p>
        <p>Use append-optimized storage for tables and partitions that are updated infrequently
          after the initial load and have subsequent inserts performed only in batch operations.
          Avoid performing singleton <codeph>INSERT</codeph>, <codeph>UPDATE</codeph>, or
            <codeph>DELETE</codeph> operations on append-optimized tables. Concurrent batch
            <codeph>INSERT</codeph> operations are acceptable, but <i>never</i> perform concurrent
          batch <codeph>UPDATE</codeph> or <codeph>DELETE</codeph> operations. </p>
        <p>The append-optimized storage model is inappropriate for frequently updated tables,
          because space occupied by rows that are updated and deleted in append-optimized tables is
          not recovered and reused as efficiently as with heap tables. Append-optimized storage is
          intended for large tables that are loaded once, updated infrequently, and queried
          frequently for analytical query processing. </p>

      <section id="row_vs_column">
        <title>Row or Column Orientation</title>
        <p>Row orientation is the traditional way to store database tuples. The columns that
          comprise a row are stored on disk contiguously, so that an entire row can be read from
          disk in a single I/O. </p>
        <p>Column orientation stores column values together on disk. A separate file is created for
          each column. If the table is partitioned, a separate file is created for each column and
          partition. When a query accesses only a small number of columns in a column-oriented table
          with many columns, the cost of I/O is substantially reduced compared to a row-oriented
          table; any columns not referenced do not have to be retrieved from disk. </p>
        <p>Row-oriented storage is recommended for transactional type workloads with iterative
          transactions where updates are required and frequent inserts are performed. Use
          row-oriented storage when selects against the table are wide, where many columns of a
          single row are needed in a query. If the majority of columns in the
            <codeph>SELECT</codeph> list or <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause is selected in queries,
          use row-oriented storage. Use row-oriented storage for general purpose or mixed workloads,
          as it offers the best combination of flexibility and performance. </p>
        <p>Column-oriented storage is optimized for read operations but it is not optimized for
          write operations; column values for a row must be written to different places on disk.
          Column-oriented tables can offer optimal query performance on large tables with many
          columns where only a small subset of columns are accessed by the queries. </p>
        <p>Another benefit of column orientation is that a collection of values of the same data
          type can be stored together in less space than a collection of mixed type values, so
          column-oriented tables use less disk space (and consequently less disk I/O) than
          row-oriented tables. Column-oriented tables also compress better than row-oriented tables. </p>
        <p>Use column-oriented storage for data warehouse analytic workloads where selects are
          narrow or aggregations of data are computed over a small number of columns. Use
          column-oriented storage for tables that have single columns that are regularly updated
          without modifying other columns in the row. Reading a complete row in a wide columnar
          table requires more time than reading the same row from a row-oriented table. It is
          important to understand that each column is a separate physical file on <i>every</i>
          segment in Greenplum Database. </p>

    <title>Compression</title>
    <body>
      <p>Greenplum Database offers a variety of options to compress append-optimized tables and
        partitions. Use compression to improve I/O across the system by allowing more data to be
        read with each disk read operation. The best practice is to set the column compression
        settings at the partition level.</p>
      <p>Note that new partitions added to a partitioned table do not automatically inherit
        compression defined at the table level; you must <i>specifically</i> define compression when
        you add new partitions. </p>
      <p>Run-length encoding (RLE) compression provides the best levels of compression. Higher
        levels of compression usually result in more compact storage on disk, but require additional
        time and CPU cycles when compressing data on writes and uncompressing on reads. Sorting
        data, in combination with the various compression options, can achieve the highest level of
        compression. </p>
      <p>Data compression should never be used for data that is stored on a compressed file system. </p>
      <p>Test different compression types and ordering methods to determine the best compression for
        your specific data. For example, you might start zstd compression at level 8 or 9 and adjust
        for best results. RLE compression works best with files that contain repetitive data.</p>

  <topic id="distribution">
    <title>Distributions</title>
    <body>
      <p>An optimal distribution that results in evenly distributed data is the most important
        factor in Greenplum Database. In an MPP shared nothing environment overall response time for
        a query is measured by the completion time for all segments. The system is only as fast as
        the slowest segment. If the data is skewed, segments with more data will take more time to
        complete, so every segment must have an approximately equal number of rows and perform
        approximately the same amount of processing. Poor performance and out of memory conditions
        may result if one segment has significantly more data to process than other segments. </p>
      <p>Consider the following best practices when deciding on a distribution strategy:<ul
          id="ul_nry_4lf_hr">
          <li>Explicitly define a column or random distribution for all tables. Do not use the
            default. </li>
          <li>Ideally, use a single column that will distribute data across all segments evenly. </li>
          <li>Do not distribute on columns that will be used in the <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause of
            a query. </li>
          <li>Do not distribute on dates or timestamps. </li>
          <li>The distribution key column data should contain unique values or very high
            cardinality. </li>
          <li>If a single column cannot achieve an even distribution, use a multi-column
            distribution key with a maximum of two columns. Additional column values do not
            typically yield a more even distribution and they require additional time in the hashing
            process.</li>
          <li>If a two-column distribution key cannot achieve an even distribution of data, use a
            random distribution. Multi-column distribution keys in most cases require motion
            operations to join tables, so they offer no advantages over a random distribution. </li>
        </ul></p>
      <p>Greenplum Database random distribution is not round-robin, so there is no guarantee of an
        equal number of records on each segment. Random distributions typically fall within a target
        range of less than ten percent variation. </p>
      <p>Optimal distributions are critical when joining large tables together. To perform a join,
        matching rows must be located together on the same segment. If data is not distributed on
        the same join column, the rows needed from one of the tables are dynamically redistributed
        to the other segments. In some cases a broadcast motion, in which each segment sends its
        individual rows to all other segments, is performed rather than a redistribution motion,
        where each segment rehashes the data and sends the rows to the appropriate segments
        according to the hash key. </p>
      <section>
        <title>Local (Co-located) Joins</title>
        <p>Using a hash distribution that evenly distributes table rows across all segments and
          results in local joins can provide substantial performance gains. When joined rows are on
          the same segment, much of the processing can be accomplished within the segment instance.
          These are called <i>local</i> or <i>co-located</i> joins. Local joins minimize data
          movement; each segment operates independently of the other segments, without network
          traffic or communications between segments. </p>
        <p>To achieve local joins for large tables commonly joined together, distribute the tables
          on the same column. Local joins require that both sides of a join be distributed on the
          same columns (and in the same order) <i>and</i> that all columns in the distribution
          clause are used when joining tables. The distribution columns must also be the same data
          type—although some values with different data types may appear to have the same
          representation, they are stored differently and hash to different values, so they are
          stored on different segments.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Data Skew</title>
        <p>Data skew is often the root cause of poor query performance and out of memory conditions.
          Skewed data affects scan (read) performance, but it also affects all other query execution
          operations, for instance, joins and group by operations. </p>
        <p>It is very important to <i>validate</i> distributions to <i>ensure</i> that data is
          evenly distributed after the initial load. It is equally important to <i>continue</i> to
          validate distributions after incremental loads. </p>
        <p>The following query shows the number of rows per segment as well as the variance from the
          minimum and maximum numbers of rows:</p>
        <codeblock>SELECT 'Example Table' AS "Table Name", 
    max(c) AS "Max Seg Rows", min(c) AS "Min Seg Rows", 
    (max(c)-min(c))*100.0/max(c) AS "Percentage Difference Between Max &amp; Min" 
FROM (SELECT count(*) c, gp_segment_id FROM facts GROUP BY 2) AS a;</codeblock>
        <p>The <codeph>gp_toolkit</codeph> schema has two views that you can use to check for
            skew.<ul id="ul_cg4_1vp_y4">
            <li>The <codeph>gp_toolkit.gp_skew_coefficients</codeph> view shows data distribution
              skew by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV) for the data stored on each
              segment. The <codeph>skccoeff</codeph>  column shows the coefficient of variation
              (CV), which is calculated as the standard deviation divided by the average. It takes
              into account both the average and variability around the average of a data series. The
              lower the value, the better. Higher values indicate greater data skew.</li>
            <li>The <codeph>gp_toolkit.gp_skew_idle_fractions</codeph> view shows data distribution
              skew by calculating the percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan,
              which is an indicator of computational skew. The <codeph>siffraction</codeph> column
              shows the percentage of the system that is idle during a table scan. This is an
              indicator of uneven data distribution or query processing skew. For example, a value
              of 0.1 indicates  10% skew, a value of 0.5 indicates 50% skew, and so on. Tables that
              have more than10% skew should have their distribution policies evaluated.</li>
          </ul></p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <title>Processing Skew</title>
        <p>Processing skew results when a disproportionate amount of data flows to, and is processed
          by, one or a few segments. It is often the culprit behind Greenplum Database performance
          and stability issues. It can happen with operations such join, sort, aggregation, and
          various OLAP operations. Processing skew happens in flight while a query is running and
          is not as easy to detect as data skew, which is caused by uneven data distribution due to
          the wrong choice of distribution keys. Data skew is present at the table level, so it can
          be easily detected and avoided by choosing optimal distribution keys. </p>
        <p>If single segments are failing, that is, not all segments on a host, it may be a
          processing skew issue. Identifying processing skew is currently a manual process. First
          look for spill files. If there is skew, but not enough to cause spill, it will not become
          a performance issue. If you determine skew exists, then find the query responsible for the
          skew.</p>
        <p>The remedy for processing skew in almost all cases is to rewrite the query. Creating
          temporary tables can eliminate skew. Temporary tables can be randomly distributed to force
          a two-stage aggregation. </p>

    <title>Partitioning</title>
    <body>
      <p>A good partitioning strategy reduces the amount of data to be scanned by reading only the
        partitions needed to satisfy a query. </p>
      <p>Each partition is a separate physical file or set of files (in the case of column-oriented
        tables) on <i>every</i> segment. Just as reading a complete row in a wide columnar table
        requires more time than reading the same row from a heap table, <i>reading all partitions in
          a partitioned table requires more time than reading the same data from a non-partitioned
          table</i>. </p>
      <p>Following are partitioning best practices:<ul id="ul_wfh_bbb_3r">
          <li>Partition large tables only, do not partition small tables. </li>
          <li>Use partitioning on large tables <i>only</i> when partition elimination (partition
            pruning) can be achieved based on query criteria and is accomplished by partitioning the
            table based on the query predicate. Whenever possible, use range partitioning instead of
            list partitioning.</li>
          <li>The query planner can selectively scan partitioned tables only when the query contains
            a direct and simple restriction of the table using immutable operators, such as
              <codeph>=</codeph>, <codeph>&lt;</codeph> , <codeph>&lt;= </codeph>,
              <codeph>&gt;</codeph>, <codeph>&gt;=</codeph>, and <codeph>&lt;&gt;</codeph>.</li>
          <li>Selective scanning recognizes <codeph>STABLE</codeph> and <codeph>IMMUTABLE</codeph>
            functions, but does not recognize <codeph>VOLATILE</codeph> functions within a query.
            For example, <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clauses such as
            <codeblock>date &gt; CURRENT_DATE</codeblock> cause the query planner to selectively
            scan partitioned tables, but a <codeph>WHERE</codeph> clause such as
            <codeblock>time &gt; TIMEOFDAY</codeblock> does not. It is important to validate that
            queries are selectively scanning partitioned tables (partitions are being eliminated) by
            examining the query <codeph>EXPLAIN</codeph> plan. </li>
          <li>Do not use default partitions. The default partition is always scanned but, more
            importantly, in many environments they tend to overfill resulting in poor performance. </li>
          <li><i>Never</i> partition and distribute tables on the same column. </li>
          <li>Do not use multi-level partitioning. While sub-partitioning is supported, it is not
            recommended because typically subpartitions contain little or no data. It is a myth that
            performance increases as the number of partitions or subpartitions increases; the
            administrative overhead of maintaining many partitions and subpartitions will outweigh
            any performance benefits. For performance, scalability and manageability, balance
            partition scan performance with the number of overall partitions.</li>
          <li>Beware of using too many partitions with column-oriented storage.</li>
          <li>Consider workload concurrency and the average number of partitions opened and scanned
            for all concurrent queries. </li>

        <title>Number of Partition and Columnar Storage Files</title>
        <p>The only hard limit for the number of files Greenplum Database supports is the operating
          system's open file limit. It is important, however, to consider the total number of files
          in the cluster, the number of files on every segment, and the total number of files on a
          host. In an MPP shared nothing environment, every node operates independently of other
          nodes. Each node is constrained by its disk, CPU, and memory. CPU and I/O constraints are
          not common with Greenplum Database, but memory is often a limiting factor because the
          query execution model optimizes query performance in memory. </p>
        <p>The optimal number of files per segment also varies based on the number of segments on
          the node, the size of the cluster, SQL access, concurrency, workload, and skew. There are
          generally six to eight segments per host, but large clusters should have fewer segments
          per host. When using partitioning and columnar storage it is important to balance the
          total number of files in the cluster, but it is <i>more</i> important to consider the
          number of files per segment and the total number of files on a node. </p>
        <p>Example with 64GB Memory per Node</p>
        <ul id="ul_nyy_tgb_3r">
          <li>Number of nodes: 16</li>
          <li>Number of segments per node: 8</li>
          <li>Average number of files per segment: 10,000</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The total number of files per node is <codeph>8*10,000 = 80,000</codeph> and the total
          number of files for the cluster is <codeph>8*16*10,000 = 1,280,000</codeph>. The number of
          files increases quickly as the number of partitions and the number of columns increase. </p>
        <p>As a general best practice, limit the total number of files per node to under 100,000. As
          the previous example shows, the optimal number of files per segment and total number of
          files per node depends on the hardware configuration for the nodes (primarily memory),
          size of the cluster, SQL access, concurrency, workload and skew. </p>

    <title>Indexes</title>

    <body>
      <p>Indexes are not generally needed in Greenplum Database. Most analytical queries operate on
        large volumes of data, while indexes are intended for locating single rows or small numbers
        of rows of data. In Greenplum Database, a sequential scan is an efficient method to read
        data as each segment contains an equal portion of the data and all segments work in parallel
        to read the data. </p>
      <p>If adding an index does not produce performance gains, drop it. Verify that every index you
        create is used by the optimizer.</p>
      <p>For queries with high selectivity, indexes may improve query performance. Create an index
        on a single column of a columnar table for drill through purposes for high cardinality
        columns that are required for highly selective queries. </p>
      <p>Do not index columns that are frequently updated. Creating an index on a column that is
        frequently updated increases the number of writes required on updates. </p>
      <p>Indexes on expressions should be used only if the expression is used frequently in queries. </p>
      <p>An index with a predicate creates a partial index that can be used to select a small number
        of rows from large tables.</p>
      <p>Avoid overlapping indexes. Indexes that have the same leading column are redundant. </p>
      <p>Indexes can improve performance on compressed append-optimized tables for queries that
        return a targeted set of rows. For compressed data, an index access method means only the
        necessary pages are uncompressed. </p>
      <p>Create selective B-tree indexes. Index selectivity is a ratio of the number of distinct
        values a column has divided by the number of rows in a table. For example, if a table has
        1000 rows and a column has 800 distinct values, the selectivity of the index is 0.8, which
        is considered good. </p>
      <p>As a general rule, drop indexes before loading data into a table. The load will run an
        order of magnitude faster than loading data into a table with indexes. After the load,
        re-create the indexes. </p>
      <p>Bitmap indexes are suited for querying and not updating. Bitmap indexes perform best when
        the column has a low cardinality—100 to 100,000 distinct values. Do not use bitmap indexes
        for unique columns, very high, or very low cardinality data. Do not use bitmap indexes for
        transactional workloads.</p>
      <p>If indexes are needed on partitioned tables, the index columns must be different than the
        partition columns. A benefit of indexing partitioned tables is that because the b-tree
        performance degrades exponentially as the size of the b-tree grows, creating indexes on
        partitioned tables creates smaller b-trees that perform better than with non-partitioned
        tables.</p>

    <title>Column Sequence and Byte Alignment</title>
    <body>

      <p>For optimum performance lay out the columns of a table to achieve data type byte alignment.
        Lay out the columns in heap tables in the following order: <ol>
          <li>Distribution and partition columns</li>
          <li>Fixed numeric types </li>
          <li>Variable data types</li>
        </ol></p>


      <p>Lay out the data types from largest to smallest, so that <codeph>BIGINT</codeph> and
          <codeph>TIMESTAMP</codeph> come before <codeph>INT</codeph> and <codeph>DATE</codeph>, and
        all of these types come before <codeph>TEXT</codeph>, <codeph>VARCHAR</codeph>, or
          <codeph>NUMERIC(x,y)</codeph>. For example, 8-byte types first (<codeph>BIGINT</codeph>,
          <codeph>TIMESTAMP</codeph>), 4-byte types next (<codeph>INT</codeph>,
          <codeph>DATE</codeph>), 2-byte types next (<codeph>SMALLINT</codeph>), and variable data
        type last (<codeph>VARCHAR</codeph>). </p>
      <p>Instead of defining columns in this sequence:</p>
      <p><codeph>Int</codeph>, <codeph>Bigint</codeph>, <codeph>Timestamp</codeph>,
          <codeph>Bigint</codeph>, <codeph>Timestamp</codeph>, <codeph>Int</codeph> (distribution
        key), <codeph>Date</codeph> (partition key), <codeph>Bigint</codeph>,
          <codeph>Smallint</codeph></p>
      <p>define the columns in this sequence:</p>
      <p><codeph>Int</codeph> (distribution key), <codeph>Date</codeph> (partition key),
          <codeph>Bigint</codeph>, <codeph>Bigint</codeph>, <codeph>Timestamp</codeph>,
          <codeph>Bigint</codeph>, <codeph>Timestamp</codeph>, <codeph>Int</codeph>,
          <codeph>Smallint</codeph></p>
