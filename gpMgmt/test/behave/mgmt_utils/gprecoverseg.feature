Feature: gprecoverseg tests

    Scenario: incremental recovery works with tablespaces
        Given the database is running
          And a tablespace is created with data
          And user stops all primary processes
          And user can start transactions
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid

        Given another tablespace is created with data
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid
          And the other tablespace is valid

    Scenario: full recovery works with tablespaces
        Given the database is running
          And a tablespace is created with data
          And user stops all primary processes
          And user can start transactions
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a -F"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid

        Given another tablespace is created with data
         When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
         Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
          And the segments are synchronized
          And the tablespace is valid
          And the other tablespace is valid

    Scenario Outline: full recovery limits number of parallel processes correctly
        Given a standard local demo cluster is created
        And 2 gprecoverseg directory under '/tmp/recoverseg' with mode '0700' is created
        And a good gprecoverseg input file is created for moving 2 mirrors
        When the user runs gprecoverseg with input file and additional args "-a -F -v <args>"
        Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And gprecoverseg should only spawn up to <coordinator_workers> workers in WorkerPool
        And check if gprecoverseg ran "$GPHOME/sbin/gpsegsetuprecovery.py" 1 times with args "-b <segHost_workers>"
        And check if gprecoverseg ran "$GPHOME/sbin/gpsegrecovery.py" 1 times with args "-b <segHost_workers>"
        And gpsegsetuprecovery should only spawn up to <segHost_workers> workers in WorkerPool

        | args      | coordinator_workers | segHost_workers |
        | -B 1 -b 1 |  1                  |  1              |

  Scenario: moving mirror to a different host must work
      Given the database is running
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
        And the information of a "mirror" segment on a remote host is saved
        And the information of the corresponding primary segment on a remote host is saved
       When user kills a "mirror" process with the saved information
        And user can start transactions
       Then the saved "mirror" segment is marked down in config
       When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a -p mdw"
       Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
       When user kills a "primary" process with the saved information
        And user can start transactions
       Then the saved "primary" segment is marked down in config
       When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a"
       Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
       When the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
       Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized

  Scenario: recovering a host with tablespaces succeeds
      Given the database is running

        # Add data including tablespaces
        And a tablespace is created with data
        And database "gptest" exists
        And the user connects to "gptest" with named connection "default"
        And the user runs psql with "-c 'CREATE TABLE public.before_host_is_down (i int) DISTRIBUTED BY (i)'" against database "gptest"
        And the user runs psql with "-c 'INSERT INTO public.before_host_is_down SELECT generate_series(1, 10000)'" against database "gptest"
        And the "public.before_host_is_down" table row count in "gptest" is saved

        # Stop one of the nodes as if for hardware replacement and remove any traces as if it was a new node.
        # Recoverseg requires the host being restored have the same hostname.
        And the user runs "gpstop -a --host sdw1"
        And gpstop should return a return code of 0
        And the user runs remote command "rm -rf /data/gpdata/*" on host "sdw1"
        And user can start transactions

        # Add data after one of the nodes is down for maintenance
        And database "gptest" exists
        And the user connects to "gptest" with named connection "default"
        And the user runs psql with "-c 'CREATE TABLE public.after_host_is_down (i int) DISTRIBUTED BY (i)'" against database "gptest"
        And the user runs psql with "-c 'INSERT INTO public.after_host_is_down SELECT generate_series(1, 10000)'" against database "gptest"
        And the "public.after_host_is_down" table row count in "gptest" is saved

        # restore the down node onto a node with the same hostname
        When the user runs "gprecoverseg -a -p sdw1"
        Then gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And all the segments are running
        And user can start transactions
        And the user runs "gprecoverseg -ra"
        And gprecoverseg should return a return code of 0
        And all the segments are running
        And the segments are synchronized
        And user can start transactions

        # verify the data
        And the tablespace is valid
        And the row count from table "public.before_host_is_down" in "gptest" is verified against the saved data
        And the row count from table "public.after_host_is_down" in "gptest" is verified against the saved data
